# Format SQL Alfred 2 Workflow

Type `formatsql` in the [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/) popup to activate the workflow.
This workflow takes whatever is in clipboard when called (preferably an SQL query) and tries to format it using [sqlformat.org API](http://sqlformat.org/api/).
The query is properly indented and identifiers are changed to uppercase.

Once the formatting is complete you will get an option to copy the result to clipboard and also be inserted in the currently active window (if applicable).
